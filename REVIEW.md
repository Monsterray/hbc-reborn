# Project review

## Plan

Review each subsystem in this order. For every finding, record the trigger,
effect, smallest safe fix, and a check that can show whether the fix works.
Prefer repair to removal. Rank confirmed defects before cleanup and future
work.

| Subsystem | What to trace | Check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Build and dependencies | Tool versions, paths, generated files, and clean builds | Build the DOL and retail WAD from a clean tree on current devkitPro |
| Startup and loader | Linker entry, memory layout, IOS handoff, DOL/ELF loading, and failure paths | Inspect the matching ELF; boot the DOL in isolated Dolphin and on a dev Wii when needed |
| Channel services | App discovery, XML, SD/NAND access, themes, network, and Wiiload | Exercise valid and malformed inputs; inspect the latest Dolphin boot log |
| UI, media, and language | Assets, rendering, input, audio, translations, and banner data | Build assets; inspect the menu and launch flow in Dolphin |
| WAD and Python tools | Python 3 paths, archive sizes, content hashes, ticket/TMD data, and secret handling | Build with a private common key; decrypt and compare both content hashes |
| WiiPAX and Wiiload | Host-tool bounds, formats, transfer errors, and platform assumptions | Build and run focused format/transfer checks |
| Documentation and release | Contributor steps, version fields, ignored artifacts, and test limits | Follow README on this Mac; verify Git excludes keys and generated files |

Use the Wii64 project's Dolphin workflow as a reference for an isolated
profile, the latest boot segment, and guest fault addresses. A WAD build check
does not prove that the WAD is safe to install on a real Wii.

## Findings

The review found these defects in the current tree. Each has a focused fix in
this change set. Build checks passed; a normal Dolphin boot does not replace a
malformed-input test.

| Area | Fixed defect | Check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Startup and loader | Truncated ELF/DOL headers, section offsets, and load ranges could pass unchecked arithmetic. | Channel DOL builds; malformed-image checks remain future work. |
| Channel services | Long app directory names and metadata arguments could overrun fixed buffers. Theme font targets could share a pointer and free it twice. | Channel DOL builds; bounds and ownership paths reviewed. |
| Channel services | A host-only update URL could dereference null; a failed NAND stat leaked a descriptor; `no_ios_reload` set the wrong flag. | Channel DOL builds; metadata and launch branches reviewed. |
| UI, media, and language | No confirmed defect in the banner, asset, or translation build path. | Clean channel build produced the banner and language assets. |
| WAD and Python tools | Retail `check` required optional DPKI keys. Changed version or packer scripts could leave a stale WAD. Python 3 division returned floats in `toblocks`. | Clean retail build and `check` pass; title version is `0x104`. |
| WiiPAX and Wiiload | An oversized upload argument could overrun its buffer. Short USB Gecko writes used the original byte count. ELF section names could read past their string table. | `tests/host_bounds.sh` passes; a forced short-write check sent exactly 5,000 bytes. |
| Documentation | `channel/README` reads as current release instructions despite describing v1.1.2. | It now points to current build instructions while retaining historical text. |

No measured hot spot emerged from this source review. Measure startup app scan
and theme load time in Dolphin before changing caches, image formats, or draw
paths.

An isolated Dolphin run of this DOL did not reach the menu. Its latest log ends
at `Setup Wii Memory...` with no guest exception. The result is inconclusive;
the crash report from an earlier direct launch was a host Qt/Cocoa abort before
emulation began. The DOL from the previous commit had reached the menu in
Dolphin and on a dev Wii, but this changed DOL still needs a runtime check.

## Future work

1. Add malformed ELF/DOL and XML runtime regression inputs, plus a durable
   forced-short-write Gecko check. They should fail cleanly and keep a normal
   DOL launch working.
2. Port the auxiliary PyWii inspection and disc tools to Python 3 when they
   are needed. The documented retail WAD path already runs under Python 3.
3. Add an isolated Dolphin smoke-test helper for the channel DOL. Compare only
   the latest boot log with the ELF from that build. Test an installed WAD in
   Dolphin before a real Wii installation test.
4. Record supported devkitPro package versions in a repeatable build check.
   Current validation is on Intel macOS with devkitPPC r50-1 and libogc 3.1.0.
